# **Scenario**
You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

## **Solution**

[Date: 13th August 2023] 
#### System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of the Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.   
#### Scope  
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from December 2023 to April 2024. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.
#### Purpose
The business has a centralised database server that is regularly used for marketing operations. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a vulnerability assessment to identify and remediate vulnerabilities before it is exploited (either accidentally or intentionally), to ensure business continuity and compliance. 
#### Risk Assessment

|Threat source|Threat event|Likelihood|Severity|Risk|  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
Customer|Alter/Delete critical information|1|3|3  
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)| Perform reconnaissance and surveillance of the organisation, install persistent and targetted network sniffers on organisational information systems to obfuscate future attacks|3|3|9  
Employee|Disrupt mission-critical operations|2|3|6 
#### Approach
Risks considered the data storage and management methods of the business. The likelihood of a threat occurrence and the impact of these potential events were weighed against the risks to day-to-day operational needs.  
#### Remediation Strategy
Implementation of authentication, authorisation, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorised users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in motion using TLS. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.
